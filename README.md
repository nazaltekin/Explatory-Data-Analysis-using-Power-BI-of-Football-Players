# Explatory Data Analysis using Power BI of FIFA 2018 Global Players

## 📋 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the FIFA 2018 dataset using **Power BI**. The goal was to visualize player distributions, analyze the relationship between potential and wages, and identify "Future Stars" for scouting purposes.

## 🎯 Business & Research Objectives
* **Scouting Intelligence:** Identify high-potential players whose market value (wage) is currently undervalued.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Compare attributes like aggression, speed, and finishing across different positions (Strikers vs. Goalkeepers).
* **Financial Analysis:** Analyze club spending patterns and player wage distributions by nationality and club.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Data Transformation
1. **Data Cleaning (Power Query):** Handled missing values, formatted currency strings into numerical values, and cleaned player nationality data.
2. **DAX Modeling:** Created custom measures for:
   - **Wage vs. Potential Ratio:** To find high-ROI players.
   - **Performance Aggregates:** Categorizing players into "Top Tier," "Mid Tier," and "Future Prospects."
3. **Dashboard Design:** Implemented interactive slicers for Nationality, Club, and Position to allow for deep-dive analysis.

## 🧰 Technical Skills
* **Tool:** Power BI Desktop
* **Data Transformation:** Power Query (M language)
* **Analytics:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
* **Design:** Interactive Dashboards, Slicers, Thematic Mapping

## 📈 Results & Key Insights
* **The "Future Stars" Segment:** Identified a cluster of players under 21 with a potential score >85 but wages below the 50th percentile.
* **Wage Correlation:** Visualized the exponential growth of wages relative to "Overall Rating," showing that the top 1% of players command 30% of the total wage pool.
* **Regional Dominance:** Mapped player nationalities to show the density of talent, with Western Europe and South America maintaining the highest "Average Potential" scores.
